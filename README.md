# Illumio
This is my submission for the Illumio Coding Challenge.

# Implementation
This implementation achieves quick lookup with O(1) complexity. I have created a dictionary with strings representing each
network rule(direction + protocol + port + ip_address). Populating the dictionary takes up most of the time. Lookup is very
simple and fast.

# Testing
I have tested all the possible combinations of input ranging from single and multiple port and IP address rules. I have also
tested edge cases with port number and IP address in the boundary of ranges. 

I am interested in joining the Platform Team
